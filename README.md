# HitboxUWP8
C# wrapper for hitbox api for Universal Windows Apps 8.1 (WP and W)

### It's simple
```cs
HitBoxClient client = new HitBoxClient(app_key, app_secret); // Initialize main class with your key and secret
client.LoggedIn += (s, args) => // Catch logged in event
{
	if(args.State == LoginEventArgs.States.OK)
	{
		// Do whatever you want
	}
};
client.Login(); // It will open a new frame with hitbox api login page
// ...
```
Only several methods are static
